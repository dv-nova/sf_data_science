### Project description    
Guess a number devised by computer in a minimal number of tries.

### Case to solve    
Write a program to guess a number in a minimal number tries.

**Contest conditions:**  
- Computer devises an integer number from 0 to 100. We need to guess it. Guessing means writing a programm to guess this number.
- Our algorithm takes into account whether the random number is greater or less than the devised one. 

**Quality metrics**     
The results are evaluated according to an average number of attempts after 1000 repetitions.
